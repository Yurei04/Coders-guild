## **Overview**
This is a conceptual website of the coder's guild of the College of Information Technology and Computer Science club/organization.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this website comes from our recent college event, CITCS Week, specifically CITCS Night, which featured a cyberpunk and tech theme. This event encouraged participants to dress in futuristic attire, creating an innovative and visually striking atmosphere. The creative concept art and artwork from the Animators Guild also influenced the design and visual elements of the website. Additionally, the Coder's Guild is temporarily inactive due to internal reasons, but this website aims to showcase its potential and keep its spirit alive. It serves as a reminder that even when things are on hold, there are always opportunities for growth and learning. The website’s aesthetic is also inspired by the world of technology—particularly programming, coding interfaces, and terminal visuals—to reflect a tech-driven experience.

## What It Does

- **Showcases the Guild's Mission:** The website clearly presents the mission of the Coder’s Guild, its purpose, and the various opportunities it offers to students.
- **Interactive Features:** It includes a chatbot to address questions and concerns about the guild, making the site more interactive and user-friendly.
- **Membership Information:** Provides a joining page for new members who want to become part of the guild.
- **Knowledge Tests:** Features a "Test Your Knowledge" section to engage users in educational quizzes related to technology and coding.
- **Engagement and Learning:** Aims to maintain interest and engagement within the community by offering valuable information and interactive learning tools.

## How I Built It

- **Technologies Used:** Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it flexible in design and functionality. The website is hosted on GitHub for easy access and sharing.
- **Design Focus:** Emphasized UI/UX design to create an engaging user experience, incorporating parallax effects, dynamic background changes, and interactive elements that align with the cyberpunk theme.
- **Customization:** Utilized open-source resources as a foundation and customized them extensively to match the cyberpunk style and showcase a tech-driven world, such as programming and coding environments.
- **Creativity and Functionality:** Designed to be both visually appealing and functional, featuring animated buttons and interactive objects to keep users engaged.

## Challenges I Ran Into

- **File Management:** Organizing the file structure effectively and ensuring all div wrappers and layout elements worked seamlessly without causing conflicts.
- **Responsiveness:** Making the website fully responsive across various screen sizes, especially for mobile devices, required extensive use of media queries and testing.
- **Time Management:** Balancing the project with schoolwork, household chores, and other responsibilities required effective time management and prioritization.
- **Technical Difficulties:** Faced challenges with merging CSS styles and JavaScript functions, requiring troubleshooting and debugging.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

I’m incredibly proud of this project and its representation of the Coder's Guild. It stands out as one of the coolest and most creatively designed projects I have worked on to date. The website not only showcases technical skills but also captures the spirit and ethos of the guild in a visually compelling way.

## What We Learned

- **Advanced UI/UX Design:** Gained deeper insights into UI/UX principles, creating visually engaging and user-friendly interfaces using CSS and JavaScript.
